Project Documents
================

Documents we use to define the technological aspects of a project.  
Originally developed @ [Colle+McVoy](http://www.collemcvoy.com)

You can think about these documents in two ways:

1. A sticker sheet list of supported technologies for a given project.  Think of it as like when you're buying a car.  If you want Bluetooth & heated seats, you gotta pay for Bluetooth & heated seats.
2. Scars that tell the details missed in previous projects.

It's very difficult to perform Quality Assurance testing when the definition of "Quality" is subjective.  We hope that this document will help reduce ambiguity in planning & establishing QA guidelines for your projects.

If you spot any items that could use more detail, or have scars of your own that you'd like to contribute, please do so.  We're all just learning from each others' mistakes.
